        INDIAN BREADS
        As in many global cuisines, bread is a foundational element of Indian food. Although often similar in ingredients and appearance, different styles of bread popular throughout the Indian subcontinent are distinguished by distinct cooking techniques, textures or types of flours ranging from pillowy flatbreads or thin crêpes to stuffed dough or crisp puffs.
        
        Integral to the Indian food experience, bread is eaten as an appetizer with various chutneys, dips or sauces as well as to accompany a snack or meal by soaking up the rich curries and gravies common to Indian food.
        
        1. Naan
        The most widely recognized Indian bread is soft, bubbly naan. This unleavened flatbread can be baked or fried and frequently appears as an accompaniment at Indian restaurants in the United States and around the world. Traditionally, naan is cooked in a tandoor, a cylindrical clay or metal oven with a high cooking temperature. The signature bread is served plain or with butter, garlic and/or chilies.

        2. Chapati
        Chapati is an unleavened flatbread made of finely ground whole wheat flour mixed into dough with water and salt that is cooked on a tava, or flat skillet. This ancient style of bread gets its name from the Hindi word chapat, which means slap or flat. The word describes the traditional method of preparing the dough by wetting one’s palms and slapping the dough between them.
        
        Chapati, known as roti in other parts of the world, is foundational to a number of other cuisines across Asia, the Middle East and the Caribbean.

        3. Paratha
        Paratha is another style of unleavened, whole-wheat flatbread and a quintessential Indian food. Thicker and more substantial than naan or chapati, paratha is prepared by coating the dough with ghee (a type of clarified butter) or oil and folding repeatedly, similar to making puff pastry, using a lamination technique.
        
        Paratha might also be layered or stuffed with other ingredients such as spiced vegetables, potatoes, lentils or paneer, a soft Indian cheese. Layered and stuffed paratha is finished with a shallow fry and often enjoyed for breakfast or as an afternoon snack.

        4. Papadam
        Papadam is a thin, deep-fried bread traditionally made with black gram bean flour that is either fried or cooked in dry heat until crisp. Perhaps more similar to a chip or tortilla, papadams are often served with Indian food accompaniments like chutneys, raita (a creamy vegetable dip) or toppings such as lime pickle, chopped onions or chilies and eaten as an appetizer or alongside a meal. 
        
        INDIAN STREET FOODS
        Street food is central to Indian food culture, with each region, state and city having its own delicacies and local favorites. Many regional Indian foods enjoyed along its bustling streets can be found across the country under different names or spellings. Most street foods are simple, filling dishes that are easy to make and eat on the go but are still rich with the bold flavors and aromas of fried dough, savory vegetables and toasted spices. 
        
        5. Samosas
        Arguably the most popular street food in India, samosas are fried or baked pastry pockets with a savory filling such as spiced potatoes, onions and peas. With origins dating back to around the 10th century, versions of samosas with different shapes and fillings can be found throughout Asia, Africa and the Middle East. The samosa has become an iconic Indian food recognized all around the world.

        6. Chaat
        Chaat actually refers to an entire category of Indian food popular throughout the country in street stalls and roadside stands. Combining aromatic spices and tangy sauces, chaat blends elements that are sweet, salty, crunchy, spicy and savory into one dish bursting with flavor and texture sensations. Although every chaat may look a little different, versions of this unique Indian food usually share a similar design.

        Begin with a starchy base such as samosas, puffed rice or fried bread. Next, add lots of vegetables such as raw onion, boiled potatoes or chopped tomatoes. A sweet, spicy or tangy chutney is then poured over the vegetables followed by a dusting of chaat masala spice blend to give the chaat its signature flavor.
        
        Finally, finish the chaat with a sprinkle of something crispy or fried such as fried potato bits, crunchy chickpeas or deep-fried noodles. Aloo chaat is a popular potato-based version of this Indian food to look for if you want to give chaat a try.
        
        7. Pani Puri
        Pani puri is a unique Indian street food experience that goes by many names throughout the country depending on the region, but it is believed to have originated in the northeastern state of Bihar.
        
        Enjoying pani puri is an interactive experience in which you use your thumb to poke a hole in one side of a round, hollow puri, a deep-fried crisp flatbread, which is then filled with a mixture of flavored water, chili powder, chaat masala, tamarind chutney, potatoes, chickpeas or onions — although spices and fillings vary across regions. Pop the entire puri in your mouth to experience an explosion of vibrant flavors and textures.

        Dosas are an icon of South Indian food, with a legacy dating back to ancient times.

Variations of dosa contain different combinations of fillings and sauces with regional varieties of dough ingredients and preparation methods. 
        
        13. Vada Pav 
        Vada pav is a vegetarian street food dish native to the central state of Maharashtra, which is home to the city of Mumbai. The popular dish consists of a deep-fried potato dumpling inside a soft bread bun accompanied by chutneys and green chili peppers.

        The soft bread roll, or pav, is an important element in several Indian street food dishes, including misal pav and pav bhaji.

Both dishes can be found with a wide variety of pairings and presentations. 
        
        15. Kathi Rolls
        Originally from Kolkata in the West Bengal state of India, kathi rolls began as a skewer-roasted kebab wrapped in paratha bread. Modern kathi rolls refer to practically any wrap with a filling folded in an Indian flatbread and containing ingredients such as eggs, chicken, mutton, chutney or chilies. The filled wrap is rolled up in paper for easy eating on the go.

        INDIAN DISHES
        Cooking styles and techniques for preparing Indian food vary greatly amongst the Northern, Western, Eastern and Southern regions of the country. The result of history, geography and migration, each region has signature styles and dishes that differentiate these unique types of Indian food from one another. 
        
        Northern Indian food can be identified by its use of dairy products like yogurt, ghee and paneer, fried snacks such as samosas, rich stews and curries and cooking in tandoors. Western Indian food is largely influenced by geography, with the Goa area drawing from its historic connections to Portugal, the Gujarat region being prominently vegetarian with a strong Chinese influence, and the state of Maharashtra relying on the sea, with fish and seafood curries cooked in coconut milk.
        
        Indian food ingredients vary depending on geography

        Eastern India is known for its desserts and influence from Tibetan and Nepali cuisines, while Southern Indian food is very diverse with bright curries and tangy sauces as well as the iconic dosa and South Indian thali. Northern Indian food is the style of Indian food most commonly found in Indian restaurants outside of the country, though other regional styles are beginning to gain international recognition. 
        
        When deciphering the names of Indian food dishes, keep in mind that masala means a blend of spices, and curry refers to a spiced sauce usually named to reflect the main ingredients such as aloo (potato), dal (lentil), chana (chickpea) or saag (spinach).
        
        23. Tandoori
        An iconic food from India, dishes labeled tandoori are typically breads or meats that have been seasoned and cooked at high temperatures in a tandoor oven. Tandoori chicken is probably the most well-known dish of this style. It consists of chunks of chicken marinated in spiced yogurt and available in a variety of heat levels.

As with other styles of curry, popular versions of saag are made with meat, fish or vegetarian paneer.

Typical dishes might include rice, dal, vegetables, roti, yogurt, chutney or pickles, and something sweet.

        An essential element of traditional Indian dishes that set them apart from other cuisines is the adept use of a wide variety of Indian spices and aromatics. The seven fundamental spices of Indian food include cardamom, cumin, clove, turmeric, coriander, cinnamon and fenugreek, although many more commonly appear throughout the diverse range of classic Indian dishes. 
        
        Types of Indian food from different regions utilize herbs and spices in unique ways that distinguish them from other areas of the country. While some spices such as garlic, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and black pepper are generally familiar in the West, the delicately balanced blends of regional spices are what give Indian food its distinct depth of flavor.
